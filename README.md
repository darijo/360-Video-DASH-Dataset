# 360-Video-DASH-Dataset

We present a software tool to source, tile, encode, and dashify VR videos. In addition, we developed a dataset composed of 9 VR videos encoded with seven tiling configurations, four segment durations, and up to four different bitrates. A corresponding tile size dataset is also provided, which can be utilised to power network simulations or trace-driven emulations.
